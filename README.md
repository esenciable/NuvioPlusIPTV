## 🆕 What's new

**Now based on Nuvio 1.1.0-beta.6.**

- **Search, your way:**
  - **Choose the order** of Live TV, On Demand and addon results in **Settings → Live TV → Search & Streams**.
  - **One look everywhere:** Live TV and On Demand results now look just like addon results.
  - **Preview behind search:** pick a live channel and it plays in the background while you keep searching.
- **On Demand in the streams list:** put the On Demand tab first, after your first addon, or last, and let auto-play choose it if you want.
- **On-screen clock:** always shown, only with the player controls, or never, with your choice of corner, size and opacity.
- **Picture shape:** 24/7 movie channels that looked stretched tall now show at their real shape with black bars. You can also set the shape yourself for each channel.
- **Recordings:**
  - **Choose how early recordings start and how long they run after the show.**
  - **See how much space each recording takes**, and hold OK on a recording for its full details.
  - **Skip through recordings that are still recording.**
- **Catch-up:**
  - **Catch-up Time Shift** for providers whose catch-up is an hour or more off.
  - **More ways to load a show** when the first one fails, and a clear message instead of endless loading.
- **Playlist expiry:** see when each account runs out, with a warning when it's a week or less away.
- **Guide Size now applies to overlay mode too,** and episode numbers can be hidden.
- **Better posters:** sports games show the channel logo instead of random movie posters, and more shows get posters.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📺 A proper TV guide
- **TiviMate-style guide:** channels down the side, a timeline across, and a line marking "now" (which you can hide). It fits **8 or more channels** on screen.
- **Guide Size:** Compact, Standard, Large or Extra Large. It sets the size of overlay mode too.
- **Group list:**
  - **Opening it:** it slides out with a tap of Left.
  - **Grouping:** optionally grouped by playlist.
  - **Browse by channel name** (satellite-box style).
- **Info panel** with the show's poster (or just the channel logo, if you prefer), time left, description, the playlist it comes from, and a live preview window.
- **Make room for more channels:** a smaller info panel, and hiding numbers, logos, names or episode numbers.
- **Badges:** catch-up icons on channels that support it, and 4K / FHD / HD / SD badges on channels you've watched.

### 🎬 Overlay mode (while watching)
- Press **Left** in full screen for a see-through guide over the video: the group's channels, the highlighted channel's schedule, and the show's details.
- **Left again** switches groups. **Right** opens the channel's full schedule, with a date picker.

### 📡 Your sources, your way
- **Multiple M3U playlists** and **multiple XMLTV guides,** merged into one guide.
- **Xtream Codes logins:**
  - **Pick what to include:** TV channels, movies & series, or both.
  - **Stream format:** Auto, TS or HLS.
  - **Account details:** expiry date, status and connections in use, with a warning before it runs out.
- **Smart guide matching:** real listings always beat "Programming" placeholders. Fine-tune any channel with **Assign EPG**.
- **Catch-up:**
  - **Watch past shows** with a seek bar, or **restart what's on now**.
  - **Follow-on playback:** carries straight on into the next show.
  - **Guide time shift** and **Catch-up time shift** for providers that are off by an hour or more.
- **Channel name editor** (like TiviMate): strip "USA:", "HD", "24/7" and similar from channel names.

### ⏺️ Recordings
- **Record a show, or a whole series,** from the guide. Shows on catch-up channels are saved from catch-up after they end, which is the most reliable way.
- **Save to this device or a USB drive.** Choose what happens when space runs low: stop recording, or delete the oldest.
- **Choose the padding:** how early recordings start and how long they keep going after the show.
- **Recordings carry on with the app closed or the box in standby**, and catch-up saves wait for the connection to come back.
- **Watch while it records,** with skipping back and forward.
- **Size and details** for every recording: channel, air time, length, size and where it's saved.

### 🗂️ Channel management
- **Manage visibility** and **reorder** for channels *and* groups.
- **Copy, rename and renumber** channels, **create your own groups,** and **number channels 1, 2, 3…** in each group.
- **Channel numbers from your playlist** are used when it has them.
- **Favorites** and **Recently watched,** with sorting that works everywhere.

### 🎞️ On Demand
- **What it is:** movies and series from your Xtream providers, with **categories or genres**, **Recently added**, **Search** and **Sort by**.
- **Your posters, not the provider's:** posters and details come from your own addons. Matched titles open on Nuvio's normal details page, with watched marks and the usual long-press menu.
- **📡 On Demand** in Nuvio's stream list, with quality, codec and audio badges. Choose where its tab goes, and whether auto-play may pick it.
- **Each title once:** duplicates are merged, and a picker lets you choose the version when there are several.

### 🔔 Watching
- **Zap** with Up/Down, type a channel number, or jump to the **last channel**.
- **Pause and rewind live TV**, even on channels without catch-up.
- **Reminders:** "Remind me" on any upcoming show, with a pop-up and a Watch button.
- **Player menu:** audio, **closed captions**, screen size, **picture shape**, stream info, **sleep timer**, record, find & stream, and watch from the beginning.
- **On-screen clock** in any corner, if you want one.
- **Smooth playback:**
  - **Match frame rate** and **audio passthrough** settings.
  - **Auto-reconnect,** plus automatic recovery from frozen or stuck streams, with the reason shown when a stream fails.

### 🔒 Parental controls
- **PIN locks:** a PIN that locks any group or category. Adult content locks automatically.

### 🔎 Part of Nuvio, not bolted on
- **In the side menu:** Live TV, On Demand and Recordings sit in Nuvio's side menu, with their settings inside Nuvio's own Settings.
- **Start page:** open the app on Home, Live TV, On Demand and more.
- **Home screen row:** your favorite channels and what's on now, next to Continue watching.
- **Live TV in Nuvio search:**
  - **Your order:** choose which results come first.
  - **Preview behind search:** live channels play in the background while you search.
- **Find & stream in Nuvio:** see a movie in the guide, and stream it through your own addons and debrid.
- **Google Drive sync:** your setup on every TV, combined correctly when you use more than one.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Does this include any channels or movies?</b></summary>

No. It only plays what you add yourself: your own playlists, guides, Xtream logins, addons and debrid services.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I don't see On Demand.</b></summary>

Turn on movies & series for your Xtream login under **Settings → Live TV → On Demand**. On Demand appears in the side menu once the first import finishes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Some channels show "Programming" or the wrong listings.</b></summary>

Long-press the channel and choose **Assign EPG**. Press Left to search, or pick a TV guide from the buttons at the top. If every channel is off by the same amount, use **Guide time shift**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Catch-up plays the wrong show (an hour or more off).</b></summary>

Run **Update now** on that playlist once, so the app learns your provider's time zone. If it's still off, set **Catch-Up Time Shift** under **Settings → Live TV → Watching**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A channel looks stretched or squashed.</b></summary>

Long-press OK while it's playing and choose **Picture shape**. Try **Use real size**; the app remembers it for that channel. **Screen size** in the same menu changes how the picture fills the screen on every channel.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My USB drive doesn't show up for recordings.</b></summary>

Open **Save Recordings To** under **Settings → Live TV → Recordings**. Drives the app can't use are listed with the reason, usually that the drive is formatted as NTFS (read-only on most TV boxes) or isn't set up as storage yet. **Drive Not Listed?** in the same list explains what to do.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Will recordings work if I close the app or turn the TV off?</b></summary>

Yes, as long as the box is in standby and not fully powered off or unplugged. Shows on catch-up channels are saved from catch-up after they end, and they're retried when the connection comes back.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sound cuts out or stops on Fire TV with Echo speakers.</b></summary>

Turn off **Audio passthrough** under **Settings → Live TV → Watching**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What does Google Drive sync store, and where?</b></summary>

Your Live TV setup, in a private app folder in your own Google Drive that only this app can see. See the [privacy policy](https://homelessbrian.github.io/privacy.html).
